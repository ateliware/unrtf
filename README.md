unrtf
=====
Unrtf is a converter from RTF to other markup formats. This repository is a fork from the original codebase located at the [GNU repository](http://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/unrtf/).
Although it supports other formats, our main focus is the HTML output.

What's new
==========
* Updated the HTML markup output to match the latest syntax
* Fixed the support for paragraph alignment
* Added support to both paragraph `space after` (\sa) and `space before` (\sb) commands
* Added support for `space between lines` (aka Line Height, \sl command)
